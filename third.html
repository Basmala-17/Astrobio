<h2>1. Challenges of Limitations of Legacy Fluxgate Magnetometer Designs for Modern Space Missions:
</h2>


 <P> 
Legacy fluxgate magnetometer designs (like the MAGIC sensor) were larger, more complex, and consumed more power.</P>
<p>
The MAGIC sensor used six large racetrack cores, which increased sensor mass and complicated boom deployment.</p>
<p>
High-performance analog electronics used in the MAGIC design were not well-suited for high-radiation environments due to their sensitivity and component limitations.</p>
<p>
High power consumption led to increased heat dissipation, causing thermal gradients that could deform deployable booms and impact sensor pointing accuracy.
Manufacturing consistency and scalability of legacy cores were limited.

    <h2>2. NASA Solutions:</h2>



<p>
The new SWIM fluxgate design uses improved metallurgy and smaller, three-core configurations, reducing sensor size by ~30% and allowing for a potential mass as low as ~110 g.</p>
<p>
The sensor design is simpler, more compact, and easier to assemble than previous designs, while still maintaining or improving performance in mass, power, volume, magnetic noise, and offset.
Power consumption is halved compared to the MAGIC sensor, reducing thermal impact on deployable booms.</p>
<p>
A new digital electronics topology replaces analog demodulation with digital demodulation and PWM-based feedback, enabling the use of lower-performance (but more radiation-tolerant) components.
The manufacturing process is now well-documented, with ~90% of SWIM cores meeting or exceeding legacy performance, allowing for reliable mass production.</p>
<p>
These improvements make SWIM suitable for high-radiation, long-duration missions, and enhance its potential for broader application in future space missions.</p>
