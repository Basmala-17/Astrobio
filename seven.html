<h2>1. Challenges of Cell and Molecular Biology :
</h2>





<h3>Unknown Effects of Space Environment on Cells:</h3>
<p>It's not fully understood how living systems — from single-celled organisms to complex tissues — respond to the unique stresses of spaceflight, such as microgravity and radiation.
</p>Biological Uncertainty at the Molecular Level:
<h3>There is limited knowledge of how gravitational changes and space conditions impact:</h3>

<p>Gene and protein expression.</p>
<p>DNA function and structure.</p>
<p>Cellular structure and communication.</p>
<p>Overall physiology at the cell, tissue, and organ levels.</p>
<h3>Unanswered Research Questions:</h3>
<p>What are the genetic and molecular mechanisms altered by spaceflight?</p>
<p>Can space conditions cause cellular dysfunction, disease, or affect development and morphogenesis?

    <h2>2. NASA Solutions:</h2>


<h3>NASA’s Research in Space Biology:</h3>
<p>
NASA conducts advanced cell and molecular biology research across multiple scientific disciplines to explore how living organisms adapt to space environments.</p>


<h3>Use of Modern Techniques Modern cell and molecular biology tools are applied to study:</h3>
<p>Changes in gene and protein expression.</p>
<p>DNA behavior under space conditions.</p>
<p>Alterations in cell morphology.</p>
<p>Communication between cells.</p>
<p>
Goal-Oriented Approach
The primary goal is to understand how spaceflight-related stressors affect biological systems at the cellular and molecular levels. This knowledge contributes to a deeper understanding of how organisms adapt to space.</p>
