<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Microgravity, as a unique hazardous factor encountered in space, can induce a series of harmful effects on living organisms. The impact of microgravity on the pivotal functional gene modules stemming from gene enrichment analysis via the regulation of miRNAs is not fully illustrated. To explore the microgravity-induced alterations in critical functional gene modules via the regulation of miRNAs, in the present study, we proposed a novel bioinformatics algorithm for the integrated analysis of miRNAome and transcriptome from short-term space-flown C. elegans.</p>
<p>
The samples of C. elegans were exposed to two space conditions, namely spaceflight (SF) and spaceflight control (SC) onboard the International Space Station for 4 days. Additionally, the samples of ground control (GC) were included for comparative analysis.</p>
<p>
 Using the present algorithm, we constructed regulatory networks of functional gene modules annotated from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their associated regulatory differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs). The results showed that functional gene modules of molting cycle, defense response, fatty acid metabolism, lysosome, and longevity regulating pathway were facilitated by 25 down-regulated DEmiRNAs (e.g., cel-miR-792, cel-miR-65, cel-miR-70, cel-lsy-6, cel-miR-796, etc.) in the SC vs. GC groups, whereas these modules were inhibited by 13 up-regulated DEmiRNAs (e.g., cel-miR-74, cel-miR-229, cel-miR-70, cel-miR-249, cel-miR-85, etc.) in the SF vs. GC groups.</p>
 <p>
  These findings indicated that microgravity could significantly alter gene expression patterns and their associated functional gene modules in short-term space-flown C. elegans. Additionally, we identified 34 miRNAs as post-transcriptional regulators that modulated these functional gene modules under microgravity conditions. Through the experimental verification, our results demonstrated that microgravity could induce the down-regulation of five critical functional gene modules (i.e., molting cycle, defense response, fatty acid metabolism, lysosome, and longevity regulating pathways) via the regulation of miRNAs in short-term space-flown C. elegans.</p>

    <p>these experiments included spaceflight (SF) and spaceflight control equipped with a 1 g centrifugal device (SC), enabling an exploration into the impact of microgravity on C. elegans. Integrated analysis of multi-omics datasets offers a pathway to investigate the changes in crucial functional gene modules orchestrated by miRNA regulation under microgravity conditions.</p>
    <p>
In the present study, we proposed a novel bioinformatics algorithm to construct regulatory networks involving functional gene modules derived from DEGs and their corresponding regulatory DEmiRNAs. Using this algorithm to perform the integrated analysis of miRNAome and transcriptome data from short-term space-flown C.</p>

 elegans, we found that microgravity can induce alterations in multiple critical functional gene modules through the regulation of miRNAs. This work can contribute to enhancing our understanding of microgravity-induced molecular alterations, particularly concerning molecular functions, through miRNAs’ regulation, and offers novel insights into health risks associated with short-term spaceflight.</p>

<h3>  Data collections and descriptions </h3>
 <p>

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive search of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database in NCBI and the GeneLab database in NASA to identify all available space experiments involving C. elegans. These experiments primarily included the ‘‘C. elegans RNA Interference in Space Experiment’’ (CERISE) (Etheridge et al., 2011; Higashibata et al., 2016) and the “C. elegans Experiments in the Shenzhou-8 spacecraft” (Gao et al., 2017, 2015a, 2015b). During these experiments, C. elegans samples</p>

Identification of differentially expressed genes in SC and SF conditions
Differential expression analysis was performed for identifying the DEGs and DEmiRNAs in C. elegans during the 4-day ISS spaceflight. Compared to the GC group, a total of 5, 489 DEGs, including 3, 458 significantly up-regulated and 2, 031 down-regulated DEGs, were determined in the SC group (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table S1). Meanwhile, compared to the GC condition, there were 151 DEmiRNAs identified in the SC group, among which 13 miRNAs showed significant up-regulation while 138 miRNAs were</p>

   <h3> Discussion</h3>
<p>
The present study attempted to explore the molecular responses and potential physiological alterations induced by microgravity in space-flown C. elegans. In this study, we selected the mRNA and miRNA microarrays in adult wild-type C. elegans derived from a 4-day spaceflight experiment onboard the ISS. The chosen space experiments included three treatments: SF, SC, and GC.</p>
<p>
 These designations facilitated the comparisons between SC vs. GC and SF vs. GC, enabling the investigation of microgravity'sM</p>
