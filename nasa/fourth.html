<section class="top p">
<p>Protein aggregation is a key process linked to many diseases, but modeling and observing it in microgravity conditions is highly challenging due to the unique effects of space environments.</p>

<h2>1. Challenges of Modeling and Observing Protein Aggregation in Microgravity Conditions :
</h2>


 <P> 

Understanding shear-induced protein aggregation relevant to neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s) is challenging under Earth’s gravity.</P>
<p>
Traditional ground-based experiments are limited in their ability to isolate and observe the precise fluid dynamics and aggregation mechanisms at the molecular level.</p>
<p>
There is a need for accurate theoretical and computational models of protein behavior in shear flow, which require validation from experimental data in relevant conditions.</p>
<p>
A lack of experimental platforms for observing real-time fluid dynamics and viscoelastic behavior in microgravity impedes progress in biophysical science and pharmaceutical development.</P>

    <h2>2. NASA Solutions:</h2>



<p>
The Ring Sheared Drop (RSD) hardware aboard the ISS provides a microgravity platform that eliminates gravitational interference, allowing clean observation of shear-induced aggregation.
Since 2016, RSD has evolved through multiple flight campaigns (latest in 2025), enabling studies of key proteins (IgG, Insulin, HSA)</p>
<p>
RSD incorporates a custom camera setup that enables Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) — a powerful technique for visualizing particle motion and validating models of fluid behavior in microgravity.</p>
<p>
In-situ imaging and velocimetry enable molecular-level analysis of fluid flow and aggregation dynamics.
Comparative flight data and Earth analog experiments are used to validate predictive models and guide future microgravity research design.</p>
<p>
Preliminary 2025 findings, including multi-geometry rheometry results, enhance understanding of viscoelastic protein behavior under shear, potentially informing new pharmaceutical and therapeutic strategies.
Data from RSD campaigns is being made accessible via the Physical Sciences Informatics (PSI) database, promoting transparency and future research collaboration.</p>
