<h3>CIPHER: Understanding Brain and Behavior Changes in Space</h3>

 <P> 
  Through Artemis, NASA astronauts are returning to the Moon in preparation for one day going to Mars. To better prepare astronauts for these long journeys, scientists need to know: How do extended durations in space change the human body?
<p>
Astronauts flying to the International Space Station can now volunteer for a suite of experiments that aim to help scientists learn more. Together, these experiments are called the Complement of Integrated Protocols for Human Exploration Research or CIPHER.</p>
<p>Brain and Behavior:
Fluids in the brain shift due to low gravity in space, and long-duration spaceflight may slightly alter brain structure. These changes could affect how the brain processes spatial information and, in turn, affect crew performance.
</p>
<p>Astronauts will: Complete cognitive tests,
Perform spatial cognition tasks using virtual reality,
Use a computer to measure proficiency in controlling a robotic arm, and
Undergo MRI scans while doing cognitive tests.</p>
<p> Scientists will: Examine how brain activity before missions differs from brain activity after missions,
Pinpoint patterns dependent on mission duration, and
Assess how changes in performance of cognitive, spatial cognition, and operational tasks relate to changes in brain structure and function.</p>

    <h2>2. Cardiovascular:</h2>

<p>Astronauts who volunteer for CIPHER will wear a specialized shirt like the one seen here on Canadian Space Agency astronaut David Saint-Jacques. This shirt measures heart rate and respiration and is worn periodically before, during, and after missions for two days at a time.</p>

<p>Long-duration spaceflight may lead to stiffer arteries and increase the risk of heart disease. Scientists want to know how these changes play out during and after extended missions.</p><h4>Credit: NASA
</h4>
<br>

<p> Astronauts will: Complete CT, MRI, and ultrasound imaging of the heart, surrounding organs and muscles, and blood vessels,
Wear a shirt that measures heart rate and respiration across two days, and
Take periodic blood pressure measurements.</p>


<p> Scientists will: Tease out patterns within and across mission durations to provide clear, objective indicators of cardiovascular health, and
Examine whether the low-gravity affects organs, muscles, and vessels near the heart.
Exercise
Exercise is a well-known strategy to counter bone and muscle loss in space. Researchers want to understand whether exercise is an effective strategy for maintaining astronaut health in long-duration spaceflight.
</p>

<p>Astronauts will: Test muscle strength and endurance throughout their missions using the station’s exercise equipment,
Track their nutrition and sleep habits, and
Navigate through an obstacle course after they land back on Earth, while at times wearing spacesuits connected to NASA’s Active Response Gravity Offload System, or ARGOS, to simulate Martian gravity.</p>
<p>Scientists will:
Evaluate crews’ abilities to carry out specific exercises over time, and
Evaluate how soon and how well crews can perform critical tasks in different gravities.

<h2>3.Sensorimotor:</h2>

<p>Insights gained through CIPHER may well be key to enabling humans to remain healthy while exploring the Moon, Mars, and beyond.


NASA is leading a return to the Moon for long-term exploration. Through the Artemis missions, NASA will land the first woman and first person of color on the Moon, using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before. Lessons learned on and around the Moon will prepare NASA for the next giant leap: sending astronauts to Mars.</p>



<p>

NASA's Human Research Program, or HRP, pursues the best methods and technologies to support safe, productive human space travel. Through science conducted in laboratories, ground-based analogs, and the International Space Station, HRP scrutinizes how spaceflight affects human bodies and behaviors. Such research drives HRP’s quest to innovate ways that keep astronauts healthy and mission-ready as space travel expands to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.</p>
