<h2>1. Challenges of Biological Uncertainty and Adaptation Challenges in Spaceflight :
</h2>


 <P> 


Spaceflight profoundly alters biology: Life on Earth evolved under stable conditions—gravity, atmosphere, light/dark cycles—which are dramatically changed in space.</P>
<p>
Aboard spacecraft like the ISS, conditions are extreme and unnatural for terrestrial organisms (e.g., 16 sunrises and sunsets per day), which terrestrial biology is not equipped to handle.
These altered conditions can lead to biological and physiological changes in animals, potentially modeling similar risks for humans.</p>
<h3>Key questions remain unanswered:
</h3>
<p>Do spaceflight effects plateau, worsen, or improve over time?</p>
<p>
Are the effects permanent or reversible after returning to Earth?
Can adverse effects be prevented or reduced?</p>
<p>
What are the minimum conditions for animals to live long-term in space and remain healthy</p>

    <h2>2. NASA Solutions:</h2>



<p>

NASA’s Space Biology Program in the animal biology area is working to understand how animals adapt or acclimate to spaceflight and altered gravity.</p>

<h3>The program uses animal models (e.g., rodents, nematodes, insects) to study:</h3>
<p>
Human disease modeling</p>
<p>
Stress responses</p>
<p>
Mechanisms of adaptation to microgravity</p>
<h3>These studies help NASA:</h3>
<p>Evaluate spaceflight hazards</p>
<p>Identify biological mechanisms of adaptation</p>
<p>Develop strategies to protect human health in space</p>
<p>Apply findings for benefits on Earth
The use of well-defined genomic models ensures deeper insights and reliable comparisons.</p>
