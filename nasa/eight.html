<h2>Problems in Space Plant Biology</h2>
<p>

<h3>1. Unknown Effects of Space Environment on Plant Growth
</h3>
<p>Microgravity and radiation may impact plant development and functioning.</p>

<p>Key biological processes at risk: photosynthesis, reproduction, metabolism, lignin formation, and defense mechanisms.
</p>

<h3>2. Plant-Microbe Interactions in Space
</h3>
<p>Limited knowledge of how spaceflight alters plant–microbe relationships.
</p>
<p>Potential consequences on plant health and food safety.
</p>

<h3>3. Challenges in Sustained Crop Production
</h3>
<p>Difficulty in maintaining crops during long-duration missions (e.g., Mars).
</p>
<p>Issues include water and nutrient delivery in microgravity and root zone management.
</p>

<h3>4. Impact of Cosmic Radiation</h3>

<p>Long-term radiation exposure may harm plant health, reduce yields, and compromise food safety.
</p>

<h3>5. Unclear Gravity Sensing Mechanisms
</h3>
<p>The molecular basis of how plants detect and respond to gravity remains uncertain.</h3>

<h2>Solutions and Approaches by NASA Space Biology
</h2>
<h3>1. Research in Microgravity on the ISS
</h3>
<p>Conducting plant biology experiments aboard the International Space Station to study plant growth in real microgravity conditions.
</p>
<p>Using ground-based controls at the Kennedy Space Center to compare results on Earth vs. space.
</p>

<h3>2. Development of Growth Chambers (Veggie)
</h3>
<p>Implementing systems like Veggie, a plant growth chamber with flat-panel lights.
</p>
<p>Allowing astronauts to grow and observe plants directly in space.
</p>

<h3>3. Successful Edible Crop Production
</h3>
<p>Growth and harvest of edible crops such as romaine lettuce and cabbage on the ISS.
</p>
<p>Plans to expand to new crops like mizuna and tomatoes.
</p>

<h3>4. Ongoing and Future Research
</h3>
<p>Investigating the nutritional composition of space-grown crops.
</p>
<p>Studying the plant microbiome in space to ensure food safety and crew health.
</p>
<p>Long-term goal: building a sustainable and nutritious food source for deep-space missions (Moon & Mars).
</p>

<h3>5. Scientific Focus Areas
</h3>
<p>Understanding how gravity impacts plant metabolism.
</p>
<p>Improving horticultural techniques for controlled environments in space.
</p>
<p>Studying effects of cosmic radiation and mechanisms of gravity sensing in plants.
