<h2>Microalgae Protein Production in Microgravity</h2>:

This image looks down on a white bowl filled with a creamy, slightly off-white substance and a metal ice cream scoop holding a ball of it. Next to the bowl is a smaller jar containing a coarse white powder.</p>
<h3> Sophie’s BioNutrients</h3>

This ice cream is one of several products made with a protein powder created from Chlorella microalgae by researchers for the SOPHONSTER investigation, which looks at whether the stress of microgravity affects the algae’s protein yield. Microalgae are nutrient dense and produce proteins with essential amino acids, beneficial fatty acids, B vitamins, iron, and fiber. These organisms also can be used to make fuel, cooking oil, medications, and materials. Learning more about microalgae growth and protein production in space could support development of sustainable alternatives to meat and dairy. Such alternatives could provide a food source on future space voyages and for people on Earth and be used to make biofuels and bioactive compounds in medicines.</p>

Microscopic motion</h3>
<p>
Multiple oval-shaped microorganisms move randomly about in this black and white image, sometimes creating ripples, bumping into each other, and moving into and out of the image.</p>

These swimming microalgae are visible thanks to the Extant Life Volumetric Imaging System or ELVIS, a fluorescent 3D imaging microscope that researchers are testing aboard the International Space Station. The investigation studies both active behaviors and genetic changes of microscopic algae and marine bacteria in response to spaceflight. ELVIS is designed to autonomously capture microscopic motion in 3D, a capability not currently available on the station. The technology could be useful for a variety of research in space and on Earth, such as monitoring water quality and detecting potentially infectious organisms.

<h3>Genetics of biofilms
</h3>

A rack with eight clear tubes lies flat on a white sheet of plastic. Hands wearing black gloves are holding the rack from the upper right and lower left corners. In the background are two pink containers, a clear plastic sleeve with a small silver item in it, and several blue plastic caps.

This preflight image shows sample chambers for the Genetic Exchange in Microgravity for Biofilm Bioremediation (GEM-B2) investigation, which examines the mechanisms of gene transfer within biofilms under microgravity conditions. Biofilms are communities of microorganisms that collect and bind to a surface. They can clog and foul water systems, often leave a residue that can cause infections, and may become resistant to antibiotics. Researchers could use results from this work to develop genetic manipulations that inhibit biofilm formation, helping to maintain crew health and safety aboard the International Space Station and on future missions.
