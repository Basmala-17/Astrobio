<h1 class="sh1">From City Lights to Moonlight: NASA Training Shows How Urban Parks Can Connect Communities with Space Science </h1>


</section>

<section class="top p">
<p>NASA’s training program highlights how urban parks can serve as gateways to space science. By transforming everyday public spaces into learning hubs, communities can connect with the wonders of the universe while fostering education, collaboration, and inspiration close to home.</p>

<h3>Engaging the Public in Space and Earth Science Through Citizen Projects</h3>

<p>Environment Observer’s NUBE (cloud) game, Our Dynamic Sun by the NASA Heliophysics Education Activation Team (HEAT) and the Night Sky Network, the Aurorasaurus Citizen Science project, and the local Solar System Ambassador Network.</p>
<p>

Participants’ sense of belonging to the Earth to Sky community increased significantly. These outcomes support NASA's strategic goal of building sustained public engagement with Earth and space science. The overwhelmingly positive feedback, with 100% of participants expressing interest in taking more courses like this, demonstrates the tremendous value it is for Earth to Sky to collaborate with the National Park Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service, as all agencies’ public communication goals are addressed.</p>

<p>This kind of collaborative work is crucial because it builds a network of science communicators who can reach thousands of visitors across Minneapolis-St. Paul's parks, nature centers, and outdoor spaces. By training local informal educators to confidently share NASA's discoveries and missions, the program expands access to space science for urban audiences throughout the Twin Cities region.</p>
<p>
The Earth to Sky team will continue fostering these valuable partnerships with the National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as other state and local agencies and nonprofit organizations.
