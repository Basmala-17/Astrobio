<h1 class="sh1">Challenges Facing Astronauts and NASA's Space Biology Solutions</h1>

<section class="top p">
<p>Space exploration is not only about technology and rockets, but also about human health. Astronauts face unique challenges in space, and NASA’s research in Space Biology seeks to understand these problems and develop solutions that protect astronauts and benefit life on Earth.</p>
<p>The space environment presents a comprehensive health challenge known as the Space Exposome, leading to serious systemic changes.

<h2>1. Challenges Facing Astronauts</h2>
<br>
<h3>Key Environmental Risks </h3>
 <P> Include ionizing radiation (cosmic rays), microgravity, hypoxia, hypercapnia (excess \text{CO}_2), hypothermia, and confinement/psychological stress. </p>

<h3>Immune Dysfunction and Viral Reactivation</h3>
<p>The onset of a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, immune imbalance, and increased reactivation of latent viruses (e.g., Human Herpes Viruses), escalating with mission duration. </p>

<h3>Neurological Risks/Parkinson's Disease </h3>
<p>Similarity between systemic changes from spaceflight and the mechanism of Parkinson's Disease (PD), including a persistent increase in basal ganglia gray matter even 7 months post-flight. </p>
<h3> Brain Sensitivity to Radiation </h3>
<p>Research showed that less-ionizing radiation induces behavioral deficits at doses 100 times lower than expected, pointing to sensitive subcellular targets (not DNA) as the source of behavioral radiation risks. </p>
<h3>Altered Cell and Microbial Functions |</h3>
  <p>Reduced phagocytic function of immune cells, increased microbial virulence, and greater antibiotic resistance in microgravity.</p> 
<h3> Kidney and Gut Health |</h3> 
<p>Increased risk of kidney stones and damage due to cosmic radiation. Also, increased gut permeability (Leaky Gut), impairing nutrient absorption. </p>

    <h2>2. NASA Solutions in Space Biology (Countermeasures)</h2>
<p>NASA Solutions in Space Biology Countermeasure
Solutions rely on designed nutrition, bioengineering, technological fixes, and leveraging open data.</p>

<h3>1-Engineered and Personalized Nutrition |</h3>
 <p> Proposed strategies include bioengineering plants to enhance their nutrient content, incorporating antioxidant-rich species, and designing personalized nutrition plans based on astronauts' individual genetics. </p>
<h3>2_ Nutritional and Molecular Interventions  </h3>
<p>Exploring the use of Probiotics to boost immune function, and natural compounds (e.g., Quercetin) to target biological pathways involved in bone health.</p> 
<h3> 3_Drug Repurposing</h3>
<p> Using a network-based approach to identify drug candidates for repurposing for Parkinson's Disease, with evidence suggesting that Metformin may mitigate disease progression.</p> 
<h3>4_Lifestyle and Fitness Improvements</h3>
<p> Implementing improvements aboard the International Space Station (ISS) such as enhanced exercise regimens, as high cardiorespiratory fitness reduces the risk of viral reactivation by 29%.</p> 
<h3>5_Artificial Gravity </h3>
<p> Exploring Artificial Gravity, which can be generated via rotation, as a future countermeasure that could stabilize compromised immune function. </p>
<h3>6_Enhanced Data Access Launching the NBISC</h3> 
<p>portal for non-human biological samples to provide easy access to over 100,000 samples to accelerate scientific</p>
