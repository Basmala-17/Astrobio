<h2>1. Challenges of Nutritional Deficiencies and Health Risks from Space-Grown Food :
</h2>


 <P> 

Nutritional challenges exist for astronauts on long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.
Space-grown lettuce was found to contain 29–31% less calcium and 25% less magnesium compared to Earth-grown lettuce, making it insufficient for astronaut dietary needs.</P>
<p>
Disrupted calcium signaling was observed in astronauts, with changes in the expression of 163 calcium-related genes, which could accelerate bone loss.</p>
<p>
Leaky gut syndrome was identified, with compromised intestinal barriers in astronauts due to altered protein regulation, impairing nutrient absorption.
These biological changes raise concerns about the long-term health and nutrition of astronauts relying on in-space food production.</P>

    <h2>2. NASA Solutions:</h2>



<p>
Solution
OSDR Analysis Working Groups (OSDR-AWG) are actively analyzing biomedical and spaceflight data from NASA’s Open Science Data Repository to understand and address these challenges.</p>
<p>
Research teams from NASA, JAXA, BioAstra, and academic institutions (e.g., Weill Cornell) are collaborating using open-access data.</p>
<p>
The proposed solution to nutrient deficiencies includes the development of bioengineered crops—plants genetically enhanced to be rich in calcium or therapeutic proteins, potentially mitigating nutrient loss and health risks in space.</p>
<p>
The OSDR-AWG initiative invites public participation, encouraging scientists and volunteers to contribute to future solutions for astronaut health and space exploration.</p>
